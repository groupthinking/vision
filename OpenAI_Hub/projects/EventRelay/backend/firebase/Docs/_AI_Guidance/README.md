# 🤖 AI Assistant Usage Guide

## 🎯 **Purpose**
This folder contains **specialized guidance for AI assistants** working with this documentation system. It ensures you can effectively navigate, understand, and utilize the comprehensive documentation structure to provide optimal assistance.

## 📋 **Essential Reading Order**

### **Before Starting Any Task:**
1. ✅ **Read this file** (`_AI_Guidance/README.md`) - Overview and instructions
2. ✅ **Read** `file_usage_guide.md` - When to use which documentation
3. ✅ **Read** `workflow_decision_tree.md` - Step-by-step decision flow

### **During Task Execution:**
- Reference the main documentation files as needed
- Update relevant documentation when making changes
- Cross-reference between related documents

## 🧠 **AI Context Understanding**

### **Your Role in This System:**
You are an **intelligent development assistant** working within a structured documentation framework designed to:
- Ensure consistent development practices
- Maintain high code quality standards
- Provide comprehensive risk management
- Enable reliable deployment processes

### **Documentation Philosophy:**
This system follows a **"documentation-driven development"** approach where:
- All decisions are documented and traceable
- Quality gates are enforced through checklists
- Risk management is proactive and systematic
- Testing is comprehensive and automated

## 🎯 **Key AI Behaviors Expected**

### **Always:**
- ✅ Consult relevant documentation **before** making changes
- ✅ Follow established workflows and checklists
- ✅ Update documentation when implementing new features
- ✅ Cross-reference related documents
- ✅ Ask for clarification when uncertain

### **Never:**
- ❌ Skip documentation consultation
- ❌ Make changes without following established processes
- ❌ Ignore risk assessments or testing requirements
- ❌ Work without understanding the full context

## 📚 **Documentation Relationships**

### **Core Dependencies:**
```
PRD Analysis → Implementation Planning → Risk Assessment → Development → Testing → Deployment
```
