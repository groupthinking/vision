# Visual Assets

This directory houses architecture diagrams, UI walkthroughs, and demo screenshots referenced by the main README.

## Architecture
- `architecture.md` – Mermaid diagram describing the high-level system topology. Render it locally with compatible Markdown viewers or using https://mermaid.live.

## Screenshots & Media
- Add UI screenshots as `png`, `jpg`, or `gif` files (e.g., `dashboard-overview.png`).
- Keep filenames lowercase and hyphenated so they render predictably across platforms.
- When adding new media, update `README.md` and include concise captions highlighting the workflow being demonstrated.

## Versioning
- Store visuals that correspond to specific releases in `docs/changelog/` alongside change notes when relevant.
- Remove deprecated assets once the associated features are retired to avoid confusion.
