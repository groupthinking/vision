## Summary of Extraction Limitations

### What Was Successfully Extracted:
✅ **Video Titles**: Both video titles were successfully extracted
✅ **Video IDs**: Correctly identified
✅ **Categories**: Automatically categorized based on content analysis
✅ **Action Generation**: Relevant actions created for each video type
✅ **Implementation Plans**: Detailed timelines and next steps provided

### What Was Limited by Current Extraction Method:
⚠️ **Individuals**: Only Damien Murphy was identified (from video title)
⚠️ **Video Duration**: Not available (marked as "Unknown")
⚠️ **View Count**: Not available (marked as "Unknown")
⚠️ **Detailed Description**: Limited to "Extracted from page"
⚠️ **Transcript Content**: Not extracted due to IP blocking issues

### Extraction Method Used:
- **Primary Method**: Page scraping (YouTube API failed with 400 Bad Request)
- **Fallback**: Successfully used page metadata extraction
- **Content Analysis**: AI-powered categorization based on available metadata

## Technical Details of Extraction Process

### Video 1 (TTMYJAw5tiA):
- **Processing Method**: Enhanced metadata analysis
