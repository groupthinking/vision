Title: Automated: Add security and triage automation artifacts

What this PR contains
---------------------
- `automation/auto_issues/0001-remove-hardcoded-api-keys.md` (security issue summary)
- `automation/auto_issues/0002-fix-requirements-fsspec.md` (build blocker)
- `automation/auto_issues/0003-cleanup-todos-fixmes.md` (tech-debt backlog)

- `automation/todo_report.json` (report generated by `tools/collect_todos.py`)

Why
---
These artifacts were created by an automated review agent to surface critical security problems (hardcoded keys), a build blocker (`fsspec` version), and technical debt TODOs. They are intentionally non-invasive (no code behaviour changes) and provide a starting point for converting findings into real GitHub issues.

Notes / Next actions
-------------------
1. Rotate any exposed keys immediately and remove sensitive values from the repo.
2. Merge this PR and then open targeted PRs for fixes (requirements.txt fix, secret removal, linting/CI hooks).
3. Use `python3 tools/collect_todos.py --output=automation/todo_report.json` to refresh the report after changes.
