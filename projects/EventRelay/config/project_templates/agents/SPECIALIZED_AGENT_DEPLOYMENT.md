## 🎯 AGENT COORDINATION STRATEGY

### Agent Communication Protocol
```
Agent 7 (Error Handling) → Agent 8 (Performance) → Agent 9 (Testing)
     ↓                        ↓                        ↓
Error Boundaries → Performance Optimization → Comprehensive Testing
     ↓                        ↓                        ↓
Production Readiness ← Quality Assurance ← Deployment Confidence
```

### Agent Handoff Points
1. **Error Handling → Performance**: Error boundaries must be stable before optimization
2. **Performance → Testing**: Optimized code must be validated through testing
3. **Testing → Production**: All tests must pass before production deployment

### Agent Success Criteria
- **Individual Agent Success**: All deliverables completed within timeframes
- **Integration Success**: Agents work together without conflicts
- **System Success**: Overall system meets production readiness criteria
